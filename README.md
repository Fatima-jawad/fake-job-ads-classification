Although internet ease the job search process for many people, it also raises the chances of falling a victim to online recruitment fraud which is a form of cybercrimes that aim to take advantage of people’s information for malicious reasons.

We’ll utilize Employment Scam Aegean Dataset (EMSCAD) dataset which is a free dataset from University of the Aegean. The dataset has 18 columns and about 18K instances. We’ll clean the data using different techniques. We’ll also handle the textual data to be used easily by the classification models. In addition, extra methods and techniques will be used to deal with the data when needed. Finally, we’ll use different classifications models to draw a conclusion about which is the best model to be used based on their performances.
